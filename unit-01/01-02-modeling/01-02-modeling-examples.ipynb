The ball is assumed to leave the bat at a height of 1 m from the ground. Our model includes the forces of gravity and air resistance. It does **not** include the effect of air due to the spin of the ball. In other words, in our model, a baseball hit with back spin and a baseball hit with top spin would travel the same distance, if all other variables are the same.\n",

        "A Monte Carlo model is a description of a system based on a set of rules and random processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**History note**: The Monte Carlo method was first developed by nuclear physicists working on the Manhattan Project in the 1940s. While designing the first nuclear weapons they ran into a problem. They could not empirically model how neutrons (the particles that drive the explosive reaction in a nuclear bomb) would travel through the core of nuclear weapon. Around the same time, the first computers were also becoming available. One physicist working on the project, Stan Ulam, had the idea that they could use computers and random numbers to model the interactions. Because it was the Manhattan Project and everything was secret it needed a code name. Stan's uncle was a gambler who had a penchant for hitting up family members for money because he \"just had to go to Monte Carlo\", his preferred gambling establishment in Monaco. For next week, we will be reading an article about this first Monte-Carlo simulation and using it as an example to flesh out the modeling process for this class of model.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example inspired by an article in [Towards AI on medium.com](https://medium.com/towards-artificial-intelligence/monte-carlo-simulation-an-in-depth-tutorial-with-python-bcf6eb7856c8#6185), we will explore the general question: \"How do casinos earn money?\" In this case, we have a simplified casino game where a player selects a chip from a bag of chips. The rules are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- There are chips containing numbers ranging from 1â100 in a bag.\n",
        "- Players can bet on even or odd chips. If they win, they double the money waged. If they lose, they lose the money waged.\n",
        "- In this game, 10 and 11 are special numbers. If we bet on evens, then 10 will be counted as an odd number, and if we bet on odds, then 11 will be counted as an even number. Therefore:\n",
        "  - if we bet on even numbers and we get 10 then we lose.\n",
        "  - if we bet on odd numbers and we get 11 then we lose.\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result of these rules, there are 100 possible outcomes when you select a chip from the bag. In 49 of the possible outcomes, you will win. In 51 of the possible outcomes you will lose. Therefore, the house (i.e. casino) always has a higher probability of winning than you do.\n",
        "\n",
        "The probability you will win is $49/100 = 0.49$ or 49%.\n",
        "\n",
        "The probability you will lose is $51/100 = 0.51$ or 51%.\n",
        "\n",
        "The difference in the proabilities (2%) is in favor of the house and is called the **house edge**. Another way to think about it is, for every \\\\$100 you bet, the house earns \\\\$2. Sure the house doesn't win every bet. But on average, for a large amount of money wagered, the house will win 2% of money wagered which is \\\\$2 on every \\\\$100.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Your job as a casino consultant is to simulate a person who starts with \\\\$10,000 and bets \\\\$100 per draw of a chip for a total of 50 bets.**"
