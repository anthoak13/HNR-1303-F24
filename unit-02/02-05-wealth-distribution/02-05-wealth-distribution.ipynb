In this model, we will create and study a very simple economic system that consists of 100 *agents* (i.e. persons) who initially have 10,000 dollars each. Two agents, chosen at random, conduct a transaction. They flip a coin, and the winner receives an amount of money equal to 10% of the poorer person's money. Therefore, each agent can only win or lose 10% of the poorer person's wealth.\n",
