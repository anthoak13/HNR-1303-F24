        "This is generally called the [Law of Large Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers). The Law of Large numbers is a theorem in statistics. It states that if you perform the same experiment multiple times, the average of the results will approach the expected value. The more experiments performed, the closer the average will be to the expected value. If it weren't for the Law of Large Numbers, Monte-Carlo simulations would not be a useful modeling tool."
