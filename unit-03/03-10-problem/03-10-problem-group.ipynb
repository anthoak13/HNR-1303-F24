        "- You should both be present when working on this notebook. Nobody should work on it alone. This is a group effort.\n",
        "- **One** person will save the notebook in their Google Drive folder shared with me. They should then share *the notebook* with the other person's gmail account so that both individuals will have access to (and can edit) the same notebook.  Notebooks don't work the same as Google Docs, so if you are both trying to edit a notebook at the same time you will have to manually merge the changes. **After it is completely finished**, the other person should save a copy of the notebook to their Google Drive.  \n",
        "- I will randomly select one person's Google Drive folder and notebook to grade the group's effort.\n",
        "- The quality of your writing important. Your responses should be detailed, logical, and followable. I would strongly recommend coming back to edit your answers a day or so after initially answering the questions. A fairly large chunk of the grade for this group assesment is the organizatin and writing quality.\n",

        "You may not use any other person or person-like resource. This includes the AI features in Google Colab or any other generative AI tool (ChatGPT, etc.) It also includes any message-board like site such as Stack Overflow or Reddit. You are responsible for using only approved resources. If you're unsure whether something is allowed, please ask me before using it.\n",

        "\n",

        "- **When to Cite**:\n",
        "  - If you refer to a **specific code example** from class materials, notebooks, or a reading.\n",
        "    - Example: \"I used the loop structure from the `02-01-random` notebook, exercise 1.\"\n",
        "  - When you use an **idea** or approach that you didn't come up with on your own, even if you modify it.\n",
        "    - Example: \"The way I calculated the probability of finding the area of a circle was based on the pre-class notebook for Day 3.\"\n",
        "  - **Even if you don't copy-paste** code, if something influenced your thinking or the way you structured your solution, it should be cited.\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **What doesn't need citation**:\n",
        "  - Basic ideas that come entirely from your own brain.\n",
        "  - Simple language constructs like loops, if-statements, or variables, unless they come directly from an example you're referencing.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Key points**\n",
        "  - It's always better to cite than to leave something out. You won't lose points for over-citing and I will give you feedback on what citations are required or not.\n",
        "  - Don't just cite when you copy code—cite when ideas or problem-solving approaches come from an outside source.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Examples of Correct Citations**:\n",
        "  - **Copied/Modified Code**: \"We used the code from the `randomwalk1D` function in the `02-03-random-walk` notebook to help structure our loop.\"\n",
        "  - **Concept or Inspiration**: \"We based our approach for determining the circle a dart landed in on the exmaple we did in class estimating $\\pi$. \""
