    "### **Citing Sources**\n",
    "\n",
    "Citing sources isn't just about copying and pasting code—it's about giving credit whenever you use ideas, inspiration, or guidance from another source, even if you don't copy directly. Here's how to handle it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When to Cite**:\n",
    "  - If you refer to a **specific code example** from class materials, notebooks, or a reading.\n",
    "    - Example: \"I used the loop structure from the `02-01-random` notebook, exercise 1.\"\n",
    "  - When you use an **idea** or approach that you didn't come up with on your own, even if you modify it.\n",
    "    - Example: \"The way I calculated the probability of finding the area of a circle was based on the pre-class notebook for Day 3.\"\n",
    "  - **Even if you don't copy-paste** code, if something influenced your thinking or the way you structured your solution, it should be cited.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **What doesn't need citation**:\n",
    "  - Basic ideas that come entirely from your own brain.\n",
    "  - Simple language constructs like loops, if-statements, or variables, unless they come directly from an example you're referencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key points**\n",
    "  - It's always better to cite than to leave something out. You won't lose points for over-citing and I will give you feedback on what citations are required or not.\n",
    "  - Don't just cite when you copy code—cite when ideas or problem-solving approaches come from an outside source.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples of Correct Citations**:\n",
    "  - **Copied/Modified Code**: \"We used the code from the `randomwalk1D` function in the `02-03-random-walk` notebook to help structure our loop.\"\n",
    "  - **Concept or Inspiration**: \"We based our approach for determining the circle a dart landed in on the exmaple we did in class estimating $\\pi$. \"\n",

    "In 2018 a pair of Portugese researchers published a paper [Monte Carlo Simulation to Evaluate Mould Growth in Walls: The Effect of Insulation, Orientation, and Finishing Coating](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1155/2018/8532167). As the paper title suggests, the reserach used Monte Carlo models to simulate the growth of mold using two different models publicly availible. For each of the models, they simulated 12 different configurations of the wall's construction. They simulated the growth of mold over one year. Time was measured in hours and the amount of mold was measured in mm. This is an odd unit to pick for amount of mold and in the paper the authors state \"with ongoing growth, unrealistic values of several hundred millimetres can be reached. Therefore, these values can only be regarded for a comparative assessment of the risk of mould development, but not as a realistic growth.\"\n",
