## Unit 2

### Day 3

I think the reading was a bit dense. I think I should do what I did for 02-01 where I have them do the reading (probably a sub-section of the reading) and then read a notebook I wrote that summarises the key ideas and provides examples in a simple context. I could even take what he is talking about in the reading and write out a simple version of the code with slides to show how changing the different parameters impacts the stock market.

The discussion on the anatomy of a MC works better in  large group I think. Start with the mdoeling process and explicitly walk through us talking just about solving the model. So we have already done the formulate model, etc. stuff.
